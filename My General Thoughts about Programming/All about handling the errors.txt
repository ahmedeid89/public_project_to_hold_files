1-try-catch blocks must only be used on part of the function and only if you want to do some actions then continue.

2-the responsiblity of handling the error of the whole function is on the caller of the function

---types of the actions
           1- hand over something and coninue.
           2- hand over something and chrash the software.
           3- coninue to retrying the same thing again.
           4- continue trying something else.
           5- jus skip the error and continue.

//old thoughts
In all your code the normal thing is not to put a try-catch block, but you put it only for one of the following reasons:-

A- when you want to :- 

           1- hand over something and coninue.
           2- hand over something and chrash the software.
           3- coninue to retrying the same thing again.
           4- continue trying something else.
           5- jus skip the error and continue.
